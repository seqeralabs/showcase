# Seqera Pipelines

Seqera Pipelines is a list of the best open-source Nextflow workflows. Finding high quality pipelines is critical, so we’ve created a tightly curated list of the very best workflows to begin with.

Every pipeline comes with curated test data, so you can import into Seqera Platform and launch a test run in just a few clicks:

The pipeline details page provides key information about the workflow. With one click, you can add pipelines to your Seqera Platform Launchpad.

Simply click the **Launch** button, specify whether you would like to add the pipeline to a Cloud or Enterprise instance, and provide your Platform user access token.

You can then select the orgaization, workspace, and compute environment for the pipeline.

If you’re more at home in the terminal, you can use the launch box to grab commands for Nextflow, [Seqera Platform CLI](015_automation_on_the_seqera_platform.md), and [nf-core/tools](https://nf-co.re/docs/nf-core-tools).
